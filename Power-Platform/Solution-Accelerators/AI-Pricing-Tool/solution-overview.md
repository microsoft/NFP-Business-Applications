## üß† AI Capabilities

The solution includes a GPT-4o-based AI Builder model called **Clothing Price Check**, which uses generative AI to assess and price clothing based on tag data, condition, and resale market trends.

### ü§ñ Key Features

- **Brand Identification** ‚Äî Detects the brand from the image input. If unidentifiable, outputs `"Brand not identified"` and prompts the user to tag a photo of the items tag.
- **Description Generation** ‚Äî Produces an item description using AI analysis of the image and metadata.
- **Price Estimation** ‚Äî Returns a realistic resale price range based on data from platforms like Poshmark, eBay, and ShopGoodwill.
- **Price Justification** ‚Äî Provides reasoning behind the price range based on item condition, demand, and market trends.
- **Fabric Composition Guess** ‚Äî Estimates the item‚Äôs material breakdown. Notes uncertainty if image input is unclear.

The model is executed with three parameters: the item image, manually entered condition, and the current year. This approach demonstrates how AI Builder can support both automated and user-defined logic.

### üßæ Example Output

```json
{
  "brand": "Nike",
  "description": "This is a navy blue Nike t-shirt with a prominent 'NIKE' logo in white and blue on the front. The shirt appears to be in good condition, with no visible signs of wear or damage.",
  "condition": "Good",
  "retail_price": 45,
  "price_range": {
    "min_price": 15,
    "max_price": 25
  },
  "price_justification": "The price range is based on the current market for used Nike t-shirts in good condition. Nike is a well-known and popular brand, and their t-shirts typically retain value well in the resale market. The condition of the shirt being good, with no visible wear and the logo being intact, supports this price range. Additionally, the presence of the tag suggests it may be new or barely used, which can slightly increase its resale value.",
  "recycling_content": "Polyester 50%, Cotton 50%"
}
```

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Capture** ‚Äî The user captures or uploads an image of a donated clothing item within the Power App.
2. **Enter Condition** ‚Äî The app prompts the user to manually enter the item's condition. This supports customization for different intake workflows.
3. **Run Price Search** ‚Äî Clicking the **Run Price Search** button executes the AI Builder model using the image, condition, and current year (autopopulated).
4. **Review Results** ‚Äî The app displays AI-generated brand, description, resale price range, retail price, recycling content, and justification.
5. **Override Values** ‚Äî A **Generate Barcode** button becomes visible. The user may override the brand, description, resale price (defaulted to the average), and retail price.
6. **Save & Tag** ‚Äî When the user clicks **Generate Barcode**, a background Power Automate flow saves the item to the `DonatedGoods` table and generates a barcode.
   - The barcode is color-coded based on a rolling 5-week logic handled within the app. This supports point-of-sale discounting policies, such as 20% off for items older than 5 weeks. The logic is configurable per organization.
7. **Store** ‚Äî The item record is saved in Dataverse, ready for inventory tracking, reporting, or downstream workflows.
8. **E-Commerce Integration (Optional)** ‚Äî A non-functional **Post to eBay** button illustrates future extensibility for online resale integration.

#### AI Builder credits ####
The following guidance is based on AI Builder licensing rates as of May 2025. Please consult the [Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130) for the latest pricing information.

  - AI Builder is licensed based on monthly capacity via the AI Builder capacity add-on. Usage is measured in **service credits**.
  - The Clothing Price Lookup model, as provided, consumes **59 credits per run**.
  - Because image quality or tagging may result in an invalid or incomplete response, we recommend budgeting for **two runs per textile**, allowing for a retry.
  - To estimate your required capacity: **Monthly Credits Needed = Textiles per Month √ó 118 credits** (i.e., 59 credits √ó 2 runs).
  - **Example**: If an organization processes 100,000 textiles per month:  
    `100,000 √ó 118 = 11,800,000 credits/month`
