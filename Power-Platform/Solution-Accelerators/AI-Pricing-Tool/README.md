## AI Builder credits ##
The following guidance is based on AI Builder licensing rates as of May 2025. Please consult the [Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130) for the latest pricing information.

  - AI Builder is licensed based on monthly capacity via the AI Builder capacity add-on. Usage is measured in **service credits**.
  - The Clothing Price Lookup model, as provided, consumes **59 credits per run**.
  - Because image quality or tagging may result in an invalid or incomplete response, we recommend budgeting for **two runs per textile**, allowing for a retry.
  - To estimate your required capacity: **Monthly Credits Needed = Textiles per Month √ó 118 credits** (i.e., 59 credits √ó 2 runs).
  - **Example**: If an organization processes 100,000 textiles per month:  
    `100,000 √ó 118 = 11,800,000 credits/month`
